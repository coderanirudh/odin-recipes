This is my first project since starting theodinproject.

I am going to create a website using only "HTML".

This website will consist of a main index page which will have links to a few recipes.
The purpose of this project is to build my HTML skills

I will visit in the future and style it up with "CSS".

With this project I have learned how to use anchor tags to redirect visitors from one page to other.
I have also learned how to add media like images to the page, descriptions or heading tags and also how to use lists.
Both the ordered list and unordered list.
